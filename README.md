# Chat Emotes

Chat Emotes is a server-side mod that utilizes the Chat Preview feature introduced in Minecraft 1.19 to provide the use of emotes like Emojis inspired by Discord and Twitch chat.
All emotes are configurable and require the players to have a resource pack installed, otherwise the chat will look normal.

As I am still developing this mod, there will be breaking changes in the configuration. I am planning to make the config Datapack-based to allow multiple Emote-Packs simultaneously.

## Client Mod

Even though this is a server-side modification, using it on a client is the equivalent of adding a resourcepack with the [Twemoji] pack.
